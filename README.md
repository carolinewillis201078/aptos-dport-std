# Aptos DPort Standard

## Overview

Aptos DPort Standard (**aptos-dport-std**) is a framework built on the Aptos blockchain to facilitate decentralized porting of assets and data. This project aims to provide a standardized way to bridge assets across different blockchain networks while ensuring security, efficiency, and transparency.

## Features

-   **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Enables seamless asset transfers between Aptos and other blockchain networks.
    
-   **Security & Compliance**: Implements robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
    
-   **Scalability**: Designed to handle high transaction volumes efficiently.
    
-   **Smart Contract Standardization**: Provides reusable smart contract templates for developers.
    
-   **Easy Integration**: Developer-friendly APIs and SDKs for seamless integration.
    

## Installation

To set up the **aptos-dport-std** project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-   Rust (latest stable version)
    
-   Move CLI & Aptos CLI
    
-   Aptos Devnet or Testnet access
    

### Clone Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/carolinewillis201078/aptos-dport-std.git
cd aptos-dport-std
```

### Build & Deploy

1.  Compile the Move smart contracts:
    

```
aptos move compile --named-addresses std=0x1
```

2.  Deploy to testnet:
    

```
aptos move publish --profile testnet
```

## Usage

### 1. Creating a New Cross-Chain Asset

```
module std::crosschain {
    public fun create_asset(owner: &signer, asset_name: vector<u8>) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### 2. Transferring Assets

```
module std::transfer {
    public fun transfer_asset(sender: &signer, receiver: address, amount: u64) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```
